By default, Geocortex Essentials ships with a library of images that can be used as layer and basemap icons in your
applications. By storing these images in this Virtual Directory, they can be used and shared by any site you create.

This Virtual Directory can be accessed via HTTP, the URL to it can be resolved using the following replacement token
in your Site.xml configuration files: {RestVirtualDirectory}.

For example, you can configure the layer icon attribute of a "Facilities" layer to the value:
"{RestVirtualDirectory}/Images/Icons/Layers/facilities-32.png".
